Make a dynamic figure. Describe the following:

data source
what you want to convey in the table
what functionality you put into the table and why
what formatting you put into the table and why

The data is sourced from https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/ from the year 2013. I mainly wanted to make it easy to quantify the data from the map I made in the previous assignment. The map gave an overall impression of the data regarding deaths and I wanted a companion table to go with it to give the actual numbers.

The table is divided into to main groups of Incidents of Cancer and Deaths from Cancer. From there, the minimum and maximum values and the ranges for each are given. This is an intuitive organization scheme that is easy to follow by anyone. Aside from that, the only feature the table has is that the heading stays visible while scrolling down.
